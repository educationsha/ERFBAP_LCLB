## Aim of the ERFBAP Protocol

The integration of wireless communication technologies with drones and mobile devices has significantly advanced Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) as a cornerstone of modern networking, supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as industry innovation (SDG 9), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), and climate action (SDG 13). Drones, operating as dynamic nodes within Network Mobility (NEMO) architectures, face critical challenges in ensuring seamless communication amidst high mobility and varying operational conditions.

Addressing these challenges requires insights from Dynamics, Solid Mechanics, and Materials Engineering to optimize design and performance while adhering to sustainable engineering principles. This study evaluates the Extended Race Free Bandwidth Allocation Protocol (ERFBAP) for Quality of Service (QoS) routing within NEMO architectures, with a focus on drone-based MANETs. By leveraging methodologies grounded in Fluids and Production Engineering, the study compares ERFBAP with the Least Connections Load Balancing (LCLB) protocol to assess its efficacy in addressing load balancing and enhancing QoS.

## Conclusion

Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in wireless networking, addressing complex communication challenges with innovative solutions. By aligning their development with sustainable engineering principles and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), FANETs have the potential to drive urban sustainability and mitigate climate-related risks.

The Extended Race Free Bandwidth Allocation Protocol (ERFBAP) outperformed Least Connections Load Balancing (LCLB), showcasing its effectiveness in optimizing communication and resource utilization. Future research should explore hybrid approaches that integrate multiple techniques to enhance QoS and address reliability issues such as packet drop rates.
